Goldbach's Conjecture from a statistical point of view

Goldbach's conjecture seems to be one of those intractable problems in mathematics. Nontheless, there are numerous examples that show if you ask a harder question, you might actually be able to solve it. This is a statistical approach by considering a population of even numbers and calculating the number of ways this number can be decomposed as sum of two even numbers, and the hope is to make a sane conjecture based on the observations. 

To Do:
- To plot the number of decompositions with two different colors based on a given function f.
